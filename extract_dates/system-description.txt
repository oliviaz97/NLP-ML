The date extractor I wrote is called extract_date, I was able to solve the problem using 7 long regex expressions and 4 concatenated regex expressions.
The program reads in an input file, and stores each line of the file inside of a list.
It then matches the regex expressions with each entry of the list using the function .findall() within four for-loops, meanwhile appending the matched result to the end of the list called result.
Finally it joins together the result list and writes the output into output.txt.
The program should be able to provide a non-exhaustive but fairly reliable process of date-extracting on a given input.
